            <p>
                I wanted to take this class as I've wanted to learn about web development and design for a while.
                 I have been on the internet for much of my life and love to build, so the idea of building an 
                 individualized website for myself from the ground up is very appealing. I don't have much 
                 experience with web programming, but do have some programming experience from previous courses. 
                 Languages include C++, C, Python, SQL, and VBA.
            </p>

                <strong> My favorite restaurant: </strong>
                <a href="http://barnaclephilsrestaurant.wordpress.com/"> Barnacle Phil's </a>
                <br>
                <EM> What I love most about this restaurant is its easy going island vibe and fresh-caught local seafood. </EM>

                <p> My favorite meal, Eggs Benedict. 
                    My preferred way of serving is a lightly toasted english muffin smeared 
                    with a small bit of hollandaise sauce, with fried canadian ham, a poached 
                    egg, topped with pleny of hollandaise and a sprinkling of chives. Serve hot. </p>
